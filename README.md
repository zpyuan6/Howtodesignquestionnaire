# Howtodesignquestionnaire

This repository describes how to design a questionnaire and some useful references. [Link](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/sus-seq)

## Single-ease questionnaire (SEQ)

The single-ease questionnaire is a one-question "survey" you can ask at the end of each task during a usability test. The SEQ is worded and labeled as:

"Overall, how difficult or easy did you find this task?" OR "Overall, this task was..."

1 = Very difficult

7 = Very easy

Task one: Update your password

User 1

SEQ score: 7
Why: Unable to find account settings

## System usability scale (SUS)

Unlike the SEQ, which looks at task-related usability, the SUS looks across the entire test or experience. What that means is, instead of looking at each task, the SUS gives you the big picture understanding of the participant's overall impression of usability and experience.

The SUS has ten questions, using a scale of 1-5; 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree:

- I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
- I found the system unnecessarily complex.
- I thought the system was easy to use.
- I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
- I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
- I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
- I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
- I found the system very cumbersome to use.
- I felt very confident using the system.
- I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

## Other metrics

- Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ), which measures the mental effort participants felt was involved in completing a task
- (After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ))[https://garyperlman.com/quest/quest.cgi?form=ASQ] has three questions that assess the usability of a task
- (NASA-TLX)[https://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/groups/tlx/], which looks into the perceived workload that it took participants to complete a task
- (SUPR-Q)[https://measuringu.com/product/suprq/] measures the usability and quality of a product's user experience
- (USE)[https://garyperlman.com/quest/quest.cgi?form=USE]
